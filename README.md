Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

A practice on website User Interface (UI) on three different browser sizes.

The HTML and JS was pre-written. Only had to focus on CSS.

The challanges were to design the UI according to Mobile-first and then a bigger screen size.
As such, there is a Media Query incorporated inside the CSS code.

As the screen size changes, the UI changes to best fit it. Most important was the utilization of space as the screen gets bigger.
For the bigger screen sizes, the 'burger-menu icon' was taken away and the visibility of the side menu restored and situated on the upper right hand corner. this will also decrease 'clicks' needed. 

And of course, as i get better at Frontend, i will come back to refactor the CSS where needed.
